# Open in Browser

This is a workflow for [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) forked from [AndrewC-B/alfred-open-in-chrome](https://github.com/AndrewC-B/alfred-open-in-chrome) and extended to include Firefox functionality as well.

## Usage Notes

- If Safari is either not open, or has no windows open, the workflow will post a notification saying so.
- If you'd like it to also post notifications when URLs are successfully sent to Chrome or Firefox, open the workflow folder (right click the workflow in Alfred and click Show in Finder) and edit the appropriate line in open_in_chrome.scpt or open_in_firefox.scpt (it's clearly marked).
- The reverse behaviour is also available (i.e.: sending URLs from Chrome or Firefox to Safari).
